          <div class="article-body">
            <p>
              The Cabinet has approved a new fertiliser distribution model to
              replace the old one that was beset with fraud and related
              malpractices.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Ministry of Agriculture has now selected eight importers and
              one distributor — Agro-Processing Trust Corporation Ltd (APTC).
            </p>

            <p>
              While officials hope to solve the fertiliser supply and
              distribution issues, some insiders say this is a temporary
              measure.
            </p>

            <p>
              It will be interesting to see if indeed the distribution to the
              farmers works well," said one person, who is familiar with
              fertiliser distribution on condition of anonymity, adding that
              "privatisation is likely to be jeopardised in the near future."
            </p>

            <p>
              APTC, a parastatal, will also do the controls at farmers' level.
              According to a new directive, in Agriculture season A&B 2017,
              farmers will buy subsidised fertiliser in their sectors from
              agro-dealers who work with APTC. Season A started at the beginning
              of September and ends in February.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to Albert Habimana, fertiliser manager at SOPAV Ltd, a
              distributor with experience in the field since 2008, the right
              time to evaluate the success or otherwise of the new model would
              be at the end of the season.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The reason why some may doubt the new distribution model is that
              the distribution company is new and previously the role had been
              carried out by many players," he explained in a phone interview,
              adding that it may work well.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to information obtained from a working group, the
              Ministry of Agriculture says everything is moving fine and
              fertiliser for rice has already been distributed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Farmers used to get fertiliser on loan and pay at the harvest
              season, when they would get money. But distributors and the
              government have made losses as many farmers did not pay.
            </p>

            <p>
              "It is not easy to get our money ; some farmers cannot be traced,
              others refused to pay, while our partners such as agronomists are
              no longer working in the same areas we distributed products," said
              Mr Habimana.
            </p>

            <p>
              He said the loss is estimated at Rwf6 billion for distributors and
              the government. The ministry did not confirm nor deny the amount
              by the time of going to press.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2008 and the years that followed, Minagri would import
              fertiliser and give distributors on loan. The distributors would
              in turn pay after farmers had paid at the harvest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The minister has not revealed the amount of money lost due to
              unpaid or un-imported fertiliser distributed, which government may
              have subsidised.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fertiliser contains nutrients that play a key role in agriculture
              productivity, which explain the importance of their timely
              availability in farming seasons.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to GDP statistics released this week, agriculture's
              contribution to GDP in 2016 Q2 was 33 per cent, while in recent
              years it has been flat.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The biggest problem in fertilizer distribution channel was
              fraud," said Mukeshima.
            </p>

            <h2>Past challenges</h2>

            <p>
              The fertiliser distribution scheme faced many challenges in the
              past but the most recent is one at all levels of distribution and
              sub-standard fertiliser that was discovered following an audit on
              the distribution channel.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We have identified many issues, including sub-standard
              fertiliser, payment claims for undelivered fertiliser or
              unimported products," said Ms Geraldine Mukeshimana, the Minister
              of Agriculture.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main importer and distributor called Top Service Ltd has been
              involved in malpractices, where it is said the company had fake
              lists of clients for delivered fertiliser ; a list it used to make
              false payment claims to Ministry of Agriculture for over Rwf400
              million on undelivered fertiliser, according to people familiar
              with the issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              The company worked with 200 agro-dealers who are currently under
              investigations while the director of main distribution company was
              recently jailed and charged in court.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Someone may say that he has received 5kg of fertiliser and later
              puts in a payment claim that he/she received 500kg, then
              government pays subsidies on 500kg, this was a problem," noted the
              Minister of Agriculture.
